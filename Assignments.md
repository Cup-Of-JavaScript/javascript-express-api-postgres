# JavaScript Express API Postgress Assignments

We are going to be building an API with 10 endpoints.  Each exercise will correspond to an API endpoint.  For example:

```
http://localhost:5150/ex1/persons/1
http://localhost:5150/ex2/persons/1/type=person
http://localhost:5150/ex3/persons/1
```

# Ex. 1



# Ex. 2

# Ex. 3

# Ex. 4

# Ex. 5

# Ex. 6

# Ex. 7

# Ex. 8

# Ex. 9

# Ex. 10
